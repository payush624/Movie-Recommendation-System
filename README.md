# Movie-Recommendation-System

A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system which attempts to predict
the preferences of a user, and make suggests based on these preferences. There are a wide
variety of applications for recommendation systems. These have become increasingly
popular over the last few years and are now utilized in most online platforms that we use.
Three
main approaches are used for our recommender systems. One is Demographic Filtering â€‹ i.e
They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or 
genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features.
Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea
behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a
higher probability of being liked by the average audience. Second is content-based filtering,
where we try to profile the users interests using information collected, and recommend items
based on that profile. The other is collaborative filtering, where we try to group similar users
together and use information about the group to make recommendations to the user.
